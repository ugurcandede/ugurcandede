I'm <a href="https://github.com/ugurcandede">Ugurcan</a>, I graduated from @Uludag University MIS department and I'm working as a full-time Java developer at <a href="https://github.com/grispiapp">Grispi</a>.

I enjoy being challenged and working on new projects. I am always trying to learn new skills and development techniques.

In particular, I like to experience new technologies and learn new programming languages as part of my career progression.
